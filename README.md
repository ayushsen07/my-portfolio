## 📖 About This Project

For a long time, I used to think that personal websites were only for well-known people or big names. I never imagined I’d build one myself. Today, I’m grateful to share this website, which represents my growth from someone curious about technology to someone actively learning and creating.

This portfolio is designed to showcase my work, highlight the skills I’ve been developing, and share a bit about who I am as a learner and aspiring engineer.
